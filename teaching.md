<br>

Since the start of my PhD, I have been heavily involved in teaching --- one of the activities I like to do most.
I have given lectures, tutorials, and workshops in many different types of courses.
I have (co-)developed two courses, one of which is a MOOC. 
So far, I have only taught in courses in the MSc programs of <em>Computer Science</em> (CS) and <em>Architecture and the Built Environment</em> (ABE) at TU Delft.

- Q3 (24-). <strong>Artificial Intelligence in Architectural Design (ABE, MSc)</strong> by <em>Seyran Khademi</em>. Co-developer, lecturer, tutorial, supervision.
- Q4 (24-). <strong>Inhabiting Data Studio (ABE, MSc)</strong> by <em>Marija Mateljan</em>. Guest lecture, tutorial.
- Q3 (24). <strong>Figures (ABE, MSc)</strong> by <em>Jurjen Zeilstra</em>. Guest lecture, tutorial.
- Q4 (25-). <strong>Computer Vision (CS, MSc)</strong> by <em>Nergis TÃ¶men, Xucong Zhang</em>. Guest lecture "Representation Learning".
