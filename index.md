<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;"></h2>

I am a PhD researcher in the faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment at TU Delft.
I am part of the AiDAPT lab, Design Data and Society Group, and Computer vision lab.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in machine learning in architectural design with a focus on floor plan machine understanding.
From time to time, I like to think about the meaning of architectural intelligence or competence.



I love the people that I work with, and I am very grateful for the vibrant and caring atmosphere we have set up over the years in our lab and groups.
It is hard to imagine that there are better places to work. 
Huge thanks to
Seyran Khademi, Georg Vrachliotis, Jan van Gemert, Fatemeh Mostafavi, Jess Chang, Marija Mateljan
